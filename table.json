These two methods will comprise: an IMF Balance sheet-based model and a static credit VaR using Monte Carlo simulation to compute expected and tail losses. These will be complemented with sensitivity analysis (see below).\n  Given the high dollarization of bank credit and the asymmetric impact of the pandemic across economic activities, the credit portfolio will be split by credit types (retail, mortgages, SMEs and commercial), currency, and main activity of the corporate borrowers. In addition, concentration risk will be assessed with a case-by- case analysis of the financial statements of the largest ten borrowers for each bank, using the results of a corporate stress test."

        "To account for the differential impact of COVID across businesses, the scenarios will simulate the evolution of value added by economic sectors. These sectors are grouped in three categories to differentiate their sensitivity to the pandemic.\n  Three scenarios are simulated at the yearly frequency, using NBG and RES models:\n  Baseline scenario using the April 2021 WEO projections. The economy starts to recover during mid-2021 from the April 2020 slump, and is supported by benign external and domestic financial conditions. However, growth momentum remains weak in the near term, as social distancing measures and the pandemic remain a drag on tourism and other contact-intensive services. The Baseline may be a conservative scenario, as the economic rebound in the first half of 2021 has been stronger than that projected in the April 2021 WEO.\n  Adverse Scenario 1: This assumes additional waves of COVID infections, which extend into late 2021 while conditions remain supportive in global financial markets. GDP growth remains sluggish in 2022, fueling unemployment and hitting household income. Firms operating in tourism-related services, particularly SMEs are severely hit, and many become insolvent. The effects of the pandemic on economic activity are long-lasting and hurt potential growth.\n  Adverse scenario 2: This scenario is assumed to be more severe and less likely than the first one, but assumes an adverse external shock. It is characterized by a widening of the sovereign spread, capital outflows including from banks non-resident deposits and sharp currency depreciation, which lead to adverse feedback effects on economic activity."
